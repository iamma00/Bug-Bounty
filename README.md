Mastering Bug Bounty Hunting: A Month-by-Month Guide

This step-by-step plan spans ~6 months, starting with solid fundamentals and progressively covering real bugs and advanced topics. Each month has clear goals, recommended resources, exercises, and milestones. We emphasize fast, practical learning – using interactive labs and real bug reports – so you build skills and confidence quickly. Below is a realistic schedule (roughly 1–1.5 months on basics, then a mix of study and hacking) with checklists to track your progress.

Month 1: Web Fundamentals and Tools

Goals: Understand how the web works (HTTP, browsers, HTML/CSS/JS) and set up your toolkit. Spend the first 4–6 weeks solidifying basics.

HTTP & Networking: Learn how the client-server model works. HTTP is *“the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol”*. Study request/response structure, methods (GET, POST, etc.), status codes, and headers. Use MDN’s HTTP overview or a tutorial to grasp this.

Browsers & DevTools: Practice inspecting sites with browser devtools (Network tab) to see live HTTP requests and responses. Observe cookies, status codes, and payloads. Learn about TLS/SSL basics and DNS lookup (browser → DNS → IP).

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Build a simple web page. MDN Web Docs’ learning area is excellent – e.g. “Learn to structure web content with HTML”, “style content using CSS”, and *“run scripts in the browser”*. Understand the DOM, events, and how scripts are sent from server to client. FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy have good crash courses too.

Web Architecture: Sketch a basic architecture diagram: browser → web server (front-end) → application server (back-end) → database. Learn about REST APIs (JSON data, endpoints) and MVC/routing. Try a simple tutorial (e.g. building a minimal Node.js/Express or PHP app) to see how URLs map to code.

Tools Setup: Install essential tools: a proxy tool (Burp Suite Community/Pro), browser (with relevant extensions), and a code editor. Learn basic curl or Postman to send custom HTTP requests. Familiarize with the OS shell (Linux/Mac) or PowerShell (Windows) for tasks like ping, netstat, etc.

Practical Exercises:

Use a local environment (e.g. XAMPP, Python’s http.server, or Node’s http-server) to serve files and practice sending requests.

Walk through a beginner lab or CTF. For example, try OWASP Juice Shop, which contains examples of many common vulnerabilities in a safe environment.

Follow PortSwigger’s “An Introduction” labs (Web Security Academy) on basic issues (HTTPS, HTML injection).


Resources: MDN Web Docs (HTTP guide; HTML/CSS/JS guides), “Web Application Hacker’s Handbook” (book) for architecture overview, HackTheBox Academy’s Web Fundamentals path, and Bugcrowd University or TryHackMe Web fundamentals.

Milestones by end of Month 1:

[ ] Explain how an HTTP request/response works, and inspect one in your browser’s devtools.

[ ] Built a static web page with HTML/CSS, and add a simple JavaScript alert.

[ ] Navigated and modified HTTP traffic using a proxy or curl.

[ ] Completed at least one interactive tutorial (e.g. MDN learning page for HTML) or lab.

[ ] Set up Burp Suite (even the free edition) and viewed intercepted traffic.



Month 2: Back-End Basics and Access Controls

Goals: Learn how servers and APIs handle requests, and understand access control concepts (authentication/authorization). Begin blending study with practice labs.

Server-Side Concepts: Explore how servers process requests. Study a simple framework’s request flow (MVC/routing). For example, in Express (Node.js) or Flask (Python), learn how URL routes invoke code and return JSON or HTML. Learn about REST principles and how APIs work. Try creating a trivial API endpoint that returns JSON (to solidify understanding of headers, status, payload).

Authentication & Sessions: Understand login/logout flows. Learn how cookies or tokens identify a user’s session. Know the difference between authentication (“are you who you say you are?”) and authorization (“are you allowed to do this?”).

Access Control & Privilege: Study broken access control: cases where the server fails to enforce permissions. PortSwigger describes broken access controls as common, critical flaws. Learn vertical privilege escalation (upgrading to admin rights) and horizontal escalation (accessing other users’ data). For example, PortSwigger notes *“Vertical privilege escalation arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality”* (e.g. a non-admin accessing an admin URL). Similarly, horizontal controls mean restricting user resources; if bypassed, one user sees another’s data.

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR): IDOR is a classic access-control bug. As defined, it occurs when *“an application uses an identifier for direct access to an object… but does not check for access control”*. In practice, this means changing parameters like user_id=123 to another ID without authorization checks. Practice with labs or DVWA to see how IDORs work. Tools like Burp’s Autorize extension can help find IDORs by testing endpoints with different tokens.

Bypass Techniques: Learn how client-side checks can be bypassed. If a site only hides buttons via JavaScript/CSS but doesn’t enforce permissions on the server, an attacker can still call the endpoint (for example by modifying HTML or using the browser console). Also note paywall bypass as a special case of access control: if premium content is meant to be protected, look for ways to request it without a proper purchase (e.g. altering payment parameters or cookies). Always assume server-side validation is required – never trust client-side blocking.

Practical Exercises:

Complete PortSwigger labs on Access Control (find all vertical/horizontal escalation labs available).

In OWASP Juice Shop, solve the “Score Board” or “IDOR” challenges, which exercise access control flaws.

Set up a simple user API (login + “profile” endpoint) and try manually bypassing a check (for example, modify the session cookie to escalate privileges).


Resources: PortSwigger Web Security Academy (Access Control modules); Bugcrowd University tutorials (Auth basics); blog write-ups (e.g. search HackerOne Hacktivity for IDOR reports via keywords). OWASP Access Control Cheat Sheet for prevention tips.

Milestones by end of Month 2:

[ ] Explained vertical vs horizontal access control issues, and identified examples.

[ ] Found an IDOR in a practice lab or toy app by modifying an object ID in the request (see).

[ ] Used a Burp extension (e.g. Autorize) or manual testing to confirm an endpoint’s improper access check.

[ ] Completed at least one PortSwigger lab on broken access control.

[ ] (Optional) Explored a paywall bypass scenario (e.g. in Juice Shop) or reviewed a Bugcrowd write-up on content bypass.



Month 3: Common Web Vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)

Goals: Dive into specific vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting and CSRF. Balance theory with hands-on labs and reading real-world reports.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Learn that XSS occurs when an attacker can inject script into a webpage viewed by others. PortSwigger explains *“XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages. These scripts run in the browser of unsuspecting users, potentially stealing data or compromising accounts”*. Study the three types of XSS: Reflected (script comes in URL or form input), Stored (script saved on server and delivered to users), and DOM-based (script runs via client-side JavaScript). Practice by inputting a simple payload (<script>alert('XSS')</script>) into text fields and observing if it executes. Learn common payloads and how to encode/evade filters.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Understand CSRF as “tricking a user’s browser into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated”. For example, if a user is logged in to their bank, a hidden form or image could submit a transfer request using their cookie. Learn how CSRF tokens work to prevent this. Practice by crafting a fake HTML form that submits to a site (while your session is active) to see if actions are taken. Ensure you know how to test CSRF: see if POST requests require a secret token or can be replayed without it.

Tools & Payloads: Use Burp Suite’s Repeater to experiment with XSS and CSRF payloads. Use the built-in Spider and Scanner (with care!) to find simple XSS. Try tools like OWASP ZAP’s CSRF detection or the Burp CSRF Scanner extension. Build or use wordlists of common XSS strings (see the Hacktivity write-ups below).

Hacktivity Reports: Study real bug reports. For XSS, search HackerOne’s Hacktivity (public report feed) for “XSS” to see examples of complex attacks. Reading how others bypass filters is invaluable. For CSRF, look for examples like forcing a POST to change settings without a token.

Practical Exercises:

Do PortSwigger XSS labs (several beginner to advanced in the Academy).

Try an intentionally vulnerable app like OWASP Juice Shop or DVWA to find stored/reflected XSS.

Craft a simple malicious form that submits on your behalf to a practice site (with and without CSRF tokens).


Resources: PortSwigger Academy (XSS and CSRF sections). OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet and CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet for defense knowledge. Blog write-ups (e.g. Google “HackerOne XSS writeup” or use). For guided learning, try a Web Security CTF or an online course focusing on XSS/CSRF.

Milestones by end of Month 3:

[ ] Demonstrated both reflected and stored XSS in a lab environment.

[ ] Found and explained how to fix a CSRF flaw in a sample app (i.e. add/validate a CSRF token).

[ ] Completed several PortSwigger labs on XSS and CSRF.

[ ] Reviewed at least one public Hacktivity report on XSS or CSRF to see a real case study.



Month 4: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Other Flaws

Goals: Learn SSRF and continue with any missing common flaws. By now you should be comfortable testing real web targets; continue with practice and new labs.

SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Study SSRF, where the server is tricked into making HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker. As described, *“SSRF occurs when an attacker manipulates a server to send unintended requests to internal or external resources. The server becomes a proxy, unknowingly exposing sensitive information or interacting with systems it shouldn’t”*. Common scenarios include URL fetchers or image fetchers that lack whitelist filtering. Practice by finding endpoints that take a URL parameter (e.g., a “fetch image” feature) and see if you can make the server reach http://localhost or cloud metadata (169.254.169.254).

Impacts of SSRF: Realize SSRF can lead to internal port scanning, data exfiltration (e.g. AWS metadata steals), and pivoting to other systems. Keep an eye on Burp Collaborator or DNS interactions from your lab to detect blind SSRF.

Other Important Flaws: Fill gaps with any flaws not covered above. For instance:

SQL Injection/Command Injection: If you haven’t already, cover basic injection bugs (Web App Hacker’s Handbook is great here). Use SQLMap and Burp intruder on simple login forms.

Clickjacking/Open Redirect/Directory Traversal: These are often “low-hanging fruit” on bug bounty targets. Take brief tutorials or labs on each (PortSwigger has clickjacking labs, for example).


Practical Exercises:

Complete PortSwigger SSRF labs and try some known exercises (HackTheBox often has SSRF in web challenges).

Set up a tiny SSRF scenario: e.g., a script that fetches a given URL and returns content. Test bypasses via IPs or DNS rebinding.

Continue solving Juice Shop challenges – by now many will be unlocked from earlier work.


Resources: PortSwigger Web Security Academy SSRF modules. Browser’s Fetch/XHR documentation for understanding request flows. Blogs like “Story of a 2.5k bounty: SSRF on Zimbra” for examples. Online videos demonstrating SSRF in practice.

Milestones by end of Month 4:

[ ] Demonstrated an SSRF attack: e.g. server fetching internal metadata or localhost via a vulnerable endpoint.

[ ] Understood how to test for and prevent SSRF (whitelist domains, block internal IPs).

[ ] Completed any remaining relevant labs (e.g. SQLi or clickjacking if needed).

[ ] Documented a test case of one advanced flaw (e.g. an open redirect found and fixed).



Month 5: Advanced Topics (Code Review, postMessage, etc.)

Goals: Learn to audit code statically and investigate modern browser APIs. This month focuses on sharpening technique and understanding tough bugs.

Secure Code Review: Practice reading code. Use GitHub to find a small web app (Node/PHP/Python) and review it for common mistakes: insecure input handling, missing authentication checks, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe deserialization. Tools: try static analyzers like Semgrep or Bandit on a sample repo. As one guide suggests, use “grep” or Linters to spot issues (e.g. search for password or eval). Study [39]: it lists key areas (input validation, auth flaws, leaked secrets) and recommends scanners like SonarQube, Dependabot, etc. You can also use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or npm audit to find known vulnerable libs.

postMessage Vulnerabilities: Learn the window.postMessage() API for cross-window messaging. It’s meant to bypass Same-Origin Policy securely, but incorrect use can cause vulnerabilities. For example, if a page listens to messages and evals content or fails to check the event.origin, an attacker page can hijack it. The YesWeHack article notes that improper postMessage use can lead to XSS or data theft. Practice: find an app that uses postMessage (e.g. with an iframe) and try sending messages from an attacker-controlled page. Ensure the code checks event.origin or uses a specific targetOrigin.

Other Cutting-Edge Bugs: Briefly explore any emerging topics:

WebSockets or API Security: If time allows, see how secure tokens on WebSockets work.

HTML5 features: e.g. Local Storage, if used insecurely.

Business Logic Flaws: Think creatively: anything that violates the intended business rules (e.g. allowing cashback without purchase). These often come from code issues revealed in review.


Practical Exercises:

Review open-source code (like Juice Shop’s Node.js code) to spot one security flaw.

Hack a small web app by modifying its code. (OWASP WebGoat has code challenges.)

Use Burp’s Repeater/Intruder on a postMessage demo to see how to inject or intercept messages.


Resources: The Medium guide on code review and tools it lists (SonarQube, Semgrep, etc.). YesWeHack’s article on postMessage vulnerabilities for concepts and examples. YouTube demos of postMessage XSS. OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (code review section).

Milestones by end of Month 5:

[ ] Identified at least one vulnerability via manual code review or static analysis (e.g. an insecure eval or hardcoded secret).

[ ] Used a tool like Semgrep or grep to scan code for issues (e.g. search for “password” or “eval” as shown in).

[ ] Demonstrated how a poorly-implemented postMessage listener can be abused (sending a malicious message to an application that doesn’t verify origin).

[ ] Reviewed a public blog or write-up on an advanced bug (e.g. a postMessage XSS case).



Month 6: Practice, Automation & Bug Hunting

Goals: Apply all you’ve learned by hunting real targets and automating your workflow. Focus on speed and efficiency: combining hacking sessions with continuous learning.

Balancing Hacking and Learning: Now split time: spend some days actively hunting on platforms (Bugcrowd, HackerOne, public VDPs) and other days learning new tactics or revisiting weak spots. Remember, progress often comes in bursts – a quiet period of research can quickly turn into a flurry of bug finds.

Tooling & Automation: Refine your toolkit. Use Burp Suite Pro (if available) or enhancements:

Burp Repeater/Intruder: for manual fiddling and fuzzing parameters.

Extensions: try Autorize for IDOR (as mentioned in a bounty guide), Turbo Intruder for high-speed fuzzing, Collaborator Everywhere for blind bugs.

Wordlists: Create and use custom wordlists. As one experienced hunter explains, default lists (SecLists, etc.) are widely used, so building your own from each target is key. Whenever you discover a new endpoint or pattern (say, in a JSON API path), add it to your personal list. Tools like dirsearch or ffuf with your custom lists will help uncover hidden content.


Learning from Real Reports: Regularly browse HackerOne Hacktivity and Bugcrowd disclosed reports for inspiration. You can filter by vulnerability type (e.g. “XSS”, “SSRF”) to see how pro hunters found and wrote up those bugs. For example, many excellent XSS write-ups are available by searching Hacktivity for “XSS”. Reading these helps you recognize patterns and clever tricks (like bypasses or payloads you hadn’t seen).

CTFs & Labs: Continue training on CTF sites or labs in parallel. HackTheBox and TryHackMe both offer web and bug bounty–style challenges to keep your skills sharp. The HackTheBox Academy (web section) is a useful course path to reinforce any gaps.

Reporting Skills: Practice writing clear reports. Join a mock or open program (some platforms allow test reports). Focus on how to document steps, reproduce bugs, and suggest fixes. Quality of reports matters as much as finding bugs.

Real Targets: Gradually start submitting to live programs. Begin with smaller scopes (e.g. lower-profile Hacktivity or smaller companies) to build confidence. Apply the “head start” strategy: some platforms regularly add new subdomains or features – monitoring scope changes and quickly testing new targets can yield easy first finds (as one guide suggests, proactive recon + timing is powerful).

Resources: Platforms (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, Intigriti, etc.), especially their training sections or blog posts. The Medium guide “Getting Started with Bug Bounty in 2025” has insights on focusing efforts and tools. Revisit PortSwigger labs as needed. Participate in /r/bugbounty or Discords to ask questions.

Milestones by end of Month 6:

[ ] Completed multiple real-world bug bounty attempts (e.g. submitted to two different programs).

[ ] Found at least one legitimate bug (even if low severity) on a live scope, or used a reconnaissance tool (like reNgine) to map a program’s assets.

[ ] Regularly use automated tools (Burp, ffuf/dirsearch with custom wordlists, semgrep scans) to speed up testing as advised.

[ ] Frequently read new disclosed reports (Hacktivity, blog write-ups) and learned something from each (techniques or payloads).

[ ] Have a personal checklist or tracker (spreadsheet or notebook) where you mark off each vulnerability you’ve practiced and the programs you’ve tested.



Tracking Progress and Final Tips

Checklist/Milestones: Use the milestones above as a checklist. At the end of each week or month, verify you’ve met the goals. Adjust pace if needed (e.g. spend more time on fundamentals if you still feel shaky).

Learning Techniques: Alternate theory with practice. When studying a topic, immediately apply it in a lab or small test case. Flashcards or summary notes can help memorize payloads and concepts. Teaching or blogging about what you learn (even as private notes) can reinforce understanding.

Efficiency: Focus on the most impactful skills first. Prioritize OWASP Top 10 and tools like Burp Suite. Automate routine tasks (wordlists, scanning) so you can explore creative exploits. Keep refining your own process – as one hunter advises, building custom wordlists and templates from each hack becomes a “database of what actually works in the wild”.

Community & Resources: Engage with the community. Read HackerOne hacktivity and security blogs regularly (like those curated on [NahamSec’s resource list]). Follow top hunters’ blogs (EdOverflow, Orange Tsai, etc.) for case studies. Try informal code review on GitHub to discover bugs in public projects.

Long-term: Even after 6 months, bug hunting is a continuous learning game. Keep cycling through new topics (e.g. mobile/web API auth flaws, platform-specific bugs). But with this structured start, you’ll have a strong foundation and the practical mindset to find real bugs efficiently.


By following this timeline—studying fundamentals intensely at first, then balancing new learning with practical hacking, and continuously iterating—you’ll build both knowledge and muscle memory in bug bounty hunting. Stay curious, be persistent, and always learn from each attempt. Good luck, and happy hunting!
